        <h3>Steps: Making the dish</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat ½ cup oil and flour over medium heat, whisking frequently, until roux is lightly toasted and resembles the color of peanut butter, 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in onion, bell pepper, celery, garlic, salt, and pepper into roux; cook, stirring frequently, until tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Add okra, cook 5 minutes more. Add half of boudin; cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Gradually whisk in chicken broth and Worcestershire into mixture until well combined. Add green onion, bay leaves, and Creole seasoning. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until thickened, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in shrimp and parsley into gumbo; cook, stirring occasionally, until shrimp are pink and firm, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>In a small skillet, heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil over medium heat. Add remaining boudin, and cook, stirring occasionally, until heated through, 5 to 10 minutes. Top servings of gumbo with boudin. Serve over rice. Garnish with parsley and Creole seasoning, if desired.</li>
        </ol>
