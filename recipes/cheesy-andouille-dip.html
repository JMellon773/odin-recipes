        <h3>Steps:: Making the dish</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Reserve ½ cup sliced andouille.</li>
            <li>In an 8-inch cast-iron skillet, cook remaining andouille, in batches if necessary, over medium heat until browned and crisp, about 10 minutes. Remove andouille using a slotted spoon, and let drain on paper towels. Wipe skillet clean, and let cool.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375°.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, stir together cream cheese, sour cream, and mayonnaise until smooth. Add ¾ cup Cheddar, ¾ cup mozzarella, tomatoes with chiles, green onion, and Creole seasoning. Stir until well combined, and fold in cooked andouille just until combined. Spray an 8-inch cast-iron skillet with cooking spray. Transfer mixture to prepared skillet. Top with remaining ¼ cup Cheddar, ¼ cup mozzarella, and reserved ½ cup andouille.</li>
            <li>Bake until golden brown and bubbly, 25 to 30 minutes. Let stand for 10 minutes, blot oil with a paper towl, if desired. Serve with chips. Garnish with green onion, if desired.</li>
